# Student Management System

## Overview

The `app` and `database` folders contain some sample code for the REST API of a hypothetical student management system. The API will be based on the Laravel framework. The goal is to allow for basic student CRUD (create, read, update and delete) operations as well as the ability to search students based on several criteria. 

Note: We are only concerned with developing the API endpoints for now. You may assume that the front-end development is being handled separately.

## Suggestions

* Start in the `api.php` route file. It has more details regarding the specific API endpoint requirements.
* Don't worry about setting up a local environment or trying to run any of the code &mdash; we're more interested in seeing how you approach the task.
* Feel free to create any files, classes or functions that you need.
* Don't hesitate to leave comments in the code if any of the requirements are ambiguous, or to shed light on any key decisions you make.
